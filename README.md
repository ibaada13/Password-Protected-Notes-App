# Password-Protected-Notes-App

This password-protected notes application is made on Android Studio. In order to login, the user must create an account by clicking on the signup option on the main page.
After signing up, an email confirmation will be sent to the email that the user has provided, and within the body of the email, there will be the password that the user signed up with. This will be there if the user forgets their password - they can refer to the confirmation email sent to their current email address. Once signed up, the user will be able to login to the app whenever, adding and deleting any notes of their choice (private, confidential, etc). Additionally, all notes and user authentication will be stored into the SQLite Database within Android Studio.
